# Purpose #
Branch for illegal edits because altering any of these are illegal:
- player (like alternate outfits)
- npc (like big mvp tombstone)
- monster (like bigger beelzebub sprite)
- map (like gray map)

### GPF Types ###
+ **eden_textures_premium.gpf**: Makes Eden a nice white color view. /lightmap ingame can reduce brightness.

### Non-GPF Types ###
+ **System/**:
  + **monster_size_effect_new.lub**: Effects and monster sizes and effects are adjusted for QoL (like illusion turtles are actually small).
  
# Installation Steps #

### Adding for GPF types ###
Note this works only for files ending with .gpf or .grf
See [master branch](https://github.com/fishdeity/iRO-Missing_Features_Additions?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-for-gpf-types-original-method) for instructions.

### Adding for Non-GPF Types ###
- #### **System/monster_size_effect_new.lub** ####
  1. Go into your Ragnarok folder's **System** folder (e.g. C:\Gravity\Ragnarok Online\System\).
  2. Download and drag & drop mine inside your System folder. It will replace the original one.
