# Installation Steps #

### Adding for GPF types (Original Method) ###
Note these instructions work only for files ending with .gpf or .grf
1. Download and install a program like **GRF Editor**: http://www.mediafire.com/?aflylbhblrzpz0h
2. Download each .gpf in the code section you wish to add to your iRO game (or press the green button **Code** -> **Download ZIP**).
   - Pictures example will use bundle_of_edits .gpf

![edits-00-click](https://github.com/fishdeity/iRO-Missing_Features_Additions/assets/56460323/664a50d1-599f-48be-ad78-f5de728d9158)

3. Make a backup copy of your iRO's **data.grf** in case you mess up.

![backup-copy](https://github.com/fishdeity/iRO-Missing_Features_Additions/assets/56460323/f5be269f-2577-4955-b7e5-f1c3b3fbc92f)

6. File -> Open -> choose your iRO's data.grf file that you will edit.

![edits-04-file_open](https://github.com/fishdeity/iRO-Missing_Features_Additions/assets/56460323/47533da0-43df-4911-bc80-3ccb0918eac8)

8. Newer GRF Browse... -> Load... -> Choose any one of the .gpf you downloaded from here
    
![edits-07-browse_load](https://github.com/fishdeity/iRO-Missing_Features_Additions/assets/56460323/a616d5e0-6566-48a5-9560-34f65996a761)

![edits-09-merge](https://github.com/fishdeity/iRO-Missing_Features_Additions/assets/56460323/a8a8f6a4-eea0-43c5-9b32-d5ae2e1607b8)

10. Repeat Step 8, 9 for any additional .gpfs you wish to add on.
11. Open the game and test it out! If there any issues, you can swap back to your backup copy data.grf

### Adding for GPF Types (Alternate Method) ###
*Note that this process has many possible ways to do, this is just 1 example.
1. In the code section above, press the green button **Code**, choose **Download ZIP**, then extract the zip file.
3. Make a backup copy of your iRO's **data.grf** in case you mess up.
4. Close all iRO game clients.
5. Move each .gpf you want added to your game into **iRO-Missing_Features_Additions-master**'s **tools** folder.
6. Go into iRO folder and move **data.grf** into that tools folder.
7. Run **merge_gpf_into_data_grf.bat**, a command prompt should open, press 1, and follow the instructions on there.
8. Now move **data.grf** back into the iRO folder.
9. Open the game and test it out! If there any issues, you can swap back to your backup copy data.grf by renaming it back to data.grf
    - You can now delete those downloaded files earlier.
    - merge_gpf_into_data_grf.bat and rsumerge.exe are suggested to be kept in case for future use again.

### Adding for Non-GPF Types ###
- #### **System/monster_size_effect_new.lub** ####
  1. Go into your Ragnarok folder's **System** folder (e.g. C:\Gravity\Ragnarok Online\System\).
  2. Download and drag & drop mine inside your System folder. It will replace the original one.
- #### **System/unidentified_shows_item.zip** ####
  1. Download my zip file, extract, then move the contents of all 5+ files into your iRO's **System** folder.
  2. Run **iteminfo.bat**, a command prompt should open, then press any button.
  3. Feel free to delete the zip file now.
      - Game updates will overwrite **iteminfo.lub**, just re-run **iteminfo.bat** each time to reupdate.
        - Make a shortcut of iteminfo.bat and place on desktop for easier access.
      - If you wish to go back to original, delete **iteminfo.lub**, then rename the **iteminfo2.lub** to iteminfo.lub.
      - customeffects.lua will be generated, it contains custom light effect for items
        - You can add/remove anything you like in here.
      - customsprites.lua will be generated, similar but with sprites instead.
